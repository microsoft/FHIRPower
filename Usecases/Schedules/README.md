# Building a Schedule Power App
As usual, I started with a Canvas app in the desktop format. If you know you’ll want a phone format in the end, then you should start with that, but I prefer the extra real estate when I’m learning about a new API (and since I’m almost always in reach of a tablet/laptop/desktop, I still rarely use apps on my phone).

Since this app is really just going to be used to verify my custom connector is working as expected, I’m going to add a connection to my custom connector first. The database cylinder icon on the left hand side of the Power App editor canvas is where you do that. (The Search text box here is misleading. It doesn’t search available connectors, but just the connectors and collections you’ve already added to the app.)

When I’m building any app that interacts with data, the first thing I try to do is build a screen that retrieves a list of an entity I’m most interested in. In my case, that means a screen to retrieve a list of Schedules. The following screenshot is indicative of the finished product.

On my first page (which I called scnList), I added a gallery control with a Blank vertical template.

I added a Refresh icon to trigger my query (and I would later add the same query to execute on the screen’s OnVisible property). I added the following to my Refresh “button’s” OnSelect property.

`ClearCollect(varSchedules, JeffTest2.GetSchedules().entry);`

This query creates an empty collection called varSchedules and assigns the table of entries from my GetSchedules connector.

FHIR queries like this result in a FHIR bundle. The bundle contains a property called entry which is a list of the objects (in this Schedules) returned by the query. Since I’m wanting to show a list of all Schedules, then I want to assign the entry property to my collection.

I then set the Items property of my galSchedules control to varSchedules.

Doing things in this order mean my varSchedules collection now understands the properties of a Schedule object (as defined by the custom connector). I can now click into the first record of my gallery control and insert several labels to display various properties of Schedule objects. To get started, I just added label controls for Id, Resource Type, Planning Horizon, Participants, and Comment.

The formula I used for Text property of these controls looks like the following:

`"Planning Horizon: " & ThisItem.resource.planningHorizon.start & " - " & ThisItem.resource.planningHorizon.end`

The code above writes the literal label, Planning Horizon: and then navigates down the current item to find the relevant property value. In this example, ThisItem equals one of the objects under entry we mentioned above. Each of these objects has it’s own property called resource and resource has properties called start and end. The ampersands are just how I concatenate these elements and property values together. (PowerApps will convert DateTime values to strings, but you can also control the formatting. For example, maybe you only wanted to show date and drop the time.)

If I “play” the app, and hit the Refresh “button”, I should see the query results of Schedule entries populate the gallery.

# Adding Filters

Getting all of the Schedules in my FHIR repository is a good first step, but an unfiltered list would include really old Schedules and Schedules for participants that I may not care about. Instead, we need to utilize filters. The filters I’m adding here may not be the best user experience, but they do prove that my filtered queries work and I can work on improving the user experience next iteration.

For Schedule entities, there are all kinds of options, but I added filters for the following:
| Use Case | Button's OnSelect formula | Example search value|
--- | --- | ---
|Filter on Participants| | 
|Filter on Schedule ID| | 
|Filter on Date| | 
|Filter on DateTime| |
|Filter on Service Category| | 
|Filter on Service Type| |

I then went back and added Reset functions (after my ClearCollect function) to my Refresh button’s OnSelect property and my scnList’s OnVisible property.

`Reset(txtFilterOnParticipant_scnList);
Reset(txtFilterOnIdentifier_scnList);
Reset(txtFilterOnDate_scnList);
Reset(txtFilterOnDateTime_scnList);
Reset(txtFilterOnServiceCategory_scnList);
Reset(txtFilterOnServiceType_scnList);`
